# Simulating Single Photon Cameras for Supervised Depth Estimation


## Project in brief
SPAD-based cameras are becoming a popular choice of sensors for direct time-of-flight 3D imaging systems. However, the depth estimates are significantly affected when the ambient light is stronger than the light source used by the 3D imaging system. This project aims to simulate a SPAD sensor and study the effect of laser power, background light strenght, scene depth and albedo on the SPAD sensor measurements.

`*Note: This project page does not cover basics of time of flight imaging and SPADs. Links to relevent blogs would be updated here soon*`
